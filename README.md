# SQL-PIZZA SALES REPORT PROJECT

I’m excited to share that I’ve completed my first SQL project on pizza sales. Using various data sources (orders, order details, pizzas, and pizza types), I’ve performed an in-depth analysis with multiple SQL queries and functions such as CREATE, JOINs, COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN, and more.

Here are some of the key insights I’ve uncovered:

Total Number of Orders: Retrieved the total count of orders placed.
Total Revenue: Calculated the overall revenue generated from pizza sales.
Highest-Priced Pizza: Identified the pizza with the highest price.
Most Common Pizza Size Ordered: Determined the most frequently ordered pizza size.
Top 5 Most Ordered Pizza Types: Listed the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.
Total Quantity of Each Pizza Category Ordered: Joined necessary tables to find this distribution.
Order Distribution by Hour: Analyzed the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
Category-Wise Pizza Distribution: Found the distribution of pizzas by category.
Average Number of Pizzas Ordered Per Day: Grouped orders by date to calculate this average.
Top 3 Most Ordered Pizza Types Based on Revenue: Identified these top pizza types.
Percentage Contribution of Each Pizza Type to Total Revenue: Calculated the contribution percentage.
Cumulative Revenue Over Time: Analyzed revenue trends over time.
Top 3 Most Ordered Pizza Types by Category: Identified the top 3 pizza types for each category based on revenue.


I hope these insights will prove useful and contribute to increasing sales.
